    \begin{SongVerse}
        As I went into the Chandelier Shop, some candles for to buy\\*%
        I went inside the Chandelier Shop, but no one could I spy\\*%
        Now I was disappointed so some angry words I said\\*%
        When I heard the sound of \emph{(clap, clap, clap)} right above me head\\*%
        When I heard the sound of \emph{(clap, clap, clap)} right above me head

    \begin{SongVerse}
        Now I was quick and I was slick, so up the stairs I fled\\*%
        And very surprised was I to find the Chandelier's wife in bed\\*%
        And with her was another man of quite considerable size\\*%
        And they were having a \emph{(clap, clap, clap)} right before me eyes\\*%
        And they were having a \emph{(clap, clap, clap)} right before me eyes

    \begin{SongVerse}
        Now when the fun was over and done, the lady raised her head\\*%
        And very surprised was she to find me standing by her bed\\*%
        "If you will be discreet me boy, if you will be so kind\\*%
        Why don't you come up for some \emph{(clap, clap, clap)} whenever you feel inclined\\*%
        Why don't you come up for some \emph{(clap, clap, clap)} whenever you feel inclined
    \end{SongVerse}
    \begin{SongVerse}
        So many the night and many the day when the Chandelier wasn't home\\*%
        To get myself some candles to the Chandelier Shop I'd roam\\*%
        But never the ones she gives to him, she'd give me instead\\*%
        A little bit more of the \emph{(clap, clap, clap)} to light me way to bed\\*%
        Just a little bit more of the \emph{(clap, clap, clap)} to light me way to bed
    \end{SongVerse}
    \begin{SongVerse}
        So come all you married men, take heed whenever you go to town\\*%
        And if you leave your wife alone be sure and tie her down\\*%
        And if you'll be so kind to her just lie her down on the floor\\*%
        And give her so much of the \emph{(clap, clap, clap)} she doesn't want anymore\\*%
        And give her so much of the \emph{(clap, clap, clap)} she doesn't want anymore
