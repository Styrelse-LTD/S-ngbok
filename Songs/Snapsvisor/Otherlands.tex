%        Other lands have vineyards without number\\*%
%        and their fruit becomes the native wine.\\*%
%        But the Swedes squeeze liquor out of lumber,\\*%
%        smelling fragrantly of terpentine.\\*%
%        Now if you can take another measure,\\*%
%        cool and clear go gurgling down the line.\\*%
%        Let's enjoy the Swedish forest pleasure.\\*%
%        Let's fill up and drink another pine!
