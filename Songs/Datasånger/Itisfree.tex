        When I find myself in front of Windows,\\*%
        Father Torvalds comes to me,\\*%
        Speaking words of Linux, ‘It is free!’.\\*%
        And when hackers crack my system\\*%
        Through some strange NT obscurity,\\*%
        He gives me the source-code, ‘It is free!’.

        It is free, it is free,\\*%
        it is free, it is free.\\*%
        Linux is the answer,\\*%
        And it’s free.

    \begin{SongVerse}
        When the broken system crashes\\*%
        And blue screens of death I see.\\*%
        There is one true rescue, and it‘s free.\\*%
        For though there may be doubts first\\*%
        It will sure bring life to your PC\\*%
        ‘Cause Linux is the answer, and it’s free.

        In the darkest night when hacking,\\*%
        Xfree stares right back at me,\\*%
        Now I’ve installed Linux, I feel free.\\*%
        No longer mad with my computer,\\*%
        No more does it crash on me\\*%
        Now I’ve installed Linux, it is free.
